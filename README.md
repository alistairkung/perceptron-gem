# Perceptron

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/perceptron`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'perceptron'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install perceptron

## Usage

Instantiate a new Perceptron with the desired number of features to track. 
```ruby 
Perceptron.create(features_number) 
  ```
The perceptron accepts a hash of the form {:vector => Vector[...], :expected => number} as training input.   
```ruby
Perceptron.train({:vector => Vector[0, 1, 0, 1], :expected => 0})
```
To make a prediction just write 
```ruby
Perceptron.predict(Vector[your_array])
```
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
